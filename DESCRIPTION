Description: The manuscript-bcsa-2024 package provides code for data analysis for the manuscript on "Light Absorbing Carbonaceous Aerosols: Concentrations and Sources in an Under-Monitored Setting". The package contains code for generating all the figures and tables in the main text and appendix. The data used in the manuscript is published as a separate R 
package called bcsa. See the full reference in the README file or access it directly at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12685803>.  
  This study used the MA200 micro-aethalometer to measure the LAC concentrations. The MA200 measures the LAC concentrations in real-time at five different wavelengths, allowing for source apportionment. 
  We used a novel clustering approach for source apportionment, explained in detail in another manuscript. See the full reference in the README file or access it at <https://doi.org/10.4209/aaqr.240095>.
